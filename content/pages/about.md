Hello. My name is Moein. I live in Seattle with my lovely wife, and I'm originally from a beautiful little town named Ramsar by the southern coast of the Caspian Sea in Iran. Living in the US as an Iranian has proven more challenging than a young hopeful me could imagine, but I try to focus on the natural and cultural beauties of both countries. It's easy for me to see that as people we are a lot more similar than different, and I hope that understanding becomes more widespread in every aspect of our relationships.

I work at Microsoft as a Software Engineer. Like many, I got obsessed with computers at a young age, and working for Microsoft became a childhood dream. Not a small dream for a little boy from a low-income family who could barely afford a PC, but I was fortunate enough to find out, many years later, that dreams are not there to come true, but to keep us going. They’re ideological beings that like biological ones come to life, mature, serve their purpose, and die to open room for new ones.

These days, on a work day, you can usually find me converting carbs and caffeine to code in a Microsoft office in Redmond. On my own time, I improve my snowboarding on The Cascades, hang out with friends and family, play soccer, board games, video games, hack small software projects or games, or write about random topics. Of course, that’s when I’m not on Youtube.
